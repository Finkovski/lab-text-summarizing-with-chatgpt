    "In this lab, I explored how different prompt styles influence the summaries generated by ChatGPT. I tested a total of five prompts using the same base review text provided in the notebook. Each prompt focused on a different summarization goal — general summary, emotional focus, topic-specific focus (e.g., shipping or price), and fact-only extraction. I also crafted a prompt for summarizing multiple reviews using a structured format.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic summary prompt delivered a well-rounded, neutral summary but often missed specific details like emotional tone or specific pain points. When I used a prompt focused on customer sentiment, the summary highlighted dissatisfaction and praise more clearly, revealing the customer’s emotional journey. This was especially helpful for understanding subjective experiences, but occasionally GPT inferred feelings that weren't explicitly stated.\n",
    "\n",
    "The shipping-focused prompt zeroed in on delivery delays and packaging issues, showing how effective a narrow prompt can be at filtering out irrelevant content. Similarly, the price-and-value prompt brought out comments on cost vs. quality, something the general prompt overlooked. The “extract-only” prompt was surprisingly accurate and useful for pulling just the objective facts — ideal for business use cases like building a product issue tracker or support database.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the multiple reviews prompt, I created a format that grouped feedback into three categories: positive, negative, and suggestions. This structured approach made it easy to identify common trends across reviews, and GPT handled the organization very well. It proved that the model can synthesize high-level insights from multiple inputs if prompted correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Learnings:\n",
    "Small changes in prompt wording drastically affect the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Focused prompts reduce noise and highlight specific user concerns.\n",
    "\n",
    "GPT sometimes “hallucinates” emotional tone or makes assumptions when the prompt is vague.\n",
    "\n",
    "Structuring the prompt (e.g., asking for categories) leads to more useful, business-friendly summaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, I learned that effective summarization with ChatGPT is less about the model and more about how you ask. Prompt engineering is a powerful skill for controlling output and extracting the kind of insight you actually need.\n",
